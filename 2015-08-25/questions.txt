## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process : s
 - Time to compute row counts : rc
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts : g
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic : a

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
	X = s + rc + g + a
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
	X = rc*(# rows)
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
	time to count one person = t
	N > (s + rc + g + a)/t
